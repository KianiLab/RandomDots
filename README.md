# Random Dot Stimulus Code

This package implements the random dots stimulus using Psychotoolbox and
Matlab. Begin your exploration of the code with [`demo_dots.m`](demo_dots.m).
To replicate the exact stimulus used in our
[publications](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/kianilab/Publications.html) you need to
carefully adjust the stimulus parameters for your experimental setup. Monitor
refresh rate, dots density, dot size, and speed are the most critical factors.
See our papers for details.
